            <h3>Challenges</h3>
        </header>
        <p>When initially designing this app I only had experience developing mobile apps for android
            but a large part of our members had iOS and a small portion had Windows phones. I did some research
            into hybrid mobile app platforms and came across ionic which was used in the first iteration of this
            app but I have since transitioned to React Native which is a more native experience.

            Learning these two platforms on my own was a bit of learning curve because I needed to improve my JavaScript
            skills and learn a new version of Firebase.</p>

            <h3>Technologies Used</h3>
        </header>
        <ul class="default">
            <li>React Native - for iOS and Android Front End</li>
            <li>JavaScript - for application logic</li>
            <li>Firebase - for realtime backend database</li>
            <li>Redux - for application state management</li>
            <li>GitHub - for version control</li>
        </ul>

            <h3>Next Steps</h3>
        </header>
        <p>Now that the app has basic functionality implemented (i.e adding events, and news posts) the next step is to add the ability
        to send push notifications to everyone who has the app installed in addition to a targeted population like all the freshman or the
            executive board members. I also need to obtain apple and android developer licences to deploy the app to the app stores. </p>
