            <h3>Design Constraints</h3>
        </header>
        <ul class="default">
            <li>Needs to frost a 9" x 13" x 3" cake</li>
            <li>Food safe</li>
            <li>Needs to be able to use round and star frosting tips</li>
            <li>Minimize user maintenance and involvement</li>
        </ul>

            <h3>Design Process</h3>
        </header>
        <p>In order to design this system we decided to split the project into 3 major subsytems, dispenser, plotter and controls.
            Research was then done on each individual subsystem to develop an intial design as shown in the image above. For the dispenser we
            are using an off the shelf frosting syringe with a 3D printed mount where the plunger is actuated by a lead screw connected to a motor.
            From testing this initial prototype we will be able to garner key insights into what works and doesn't work which will inform our
            decisions when making our own custom dispenser. The plotter is based off of an open source CNC machine build which we will modify to suit
            our needs. The main controller will be based off of an Arduino mega.

            <h3>Current Status & Next Steps</h3>
        </header>
        <p>Currently, we have finished testing the initial dispenser prototype and have begun our second iteration of the dispenser. The plotter is
        in the process of being built and the motors have been tested and work well with the control system. In terms of software we are currently
        able to take a user uploaded image and map them to instructions that will be understood by the Arduino which controls the motors on the plotter.
